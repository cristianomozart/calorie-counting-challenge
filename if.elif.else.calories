#Each meal has its calorie count. You need to choose one meal for each time of the day. 
#Your goal is to sum up these meals to reach as close to 1500 calories as possible without going over.

#If the total is exactly 1500 calories, print: You ate your exactly calorie target intake.
#If the total is less than 1500 calories, indicate how many calories they are under.
#If the total exceeds 1500 calories, print a message that they've gone over the limit.
